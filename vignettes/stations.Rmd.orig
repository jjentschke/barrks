To calculate the phenology based on station data, `phenology()` should be called
with a data frame as input. It should have a `date` column whose values need
to be interpretable by `as.Date()`, and a `station` column that specifies the
name of the respective station. Additional columns provide the actual
parameters used by the model. This vignette uses the station data provided by
barrks as sample data.

```{r message=FALSE}

station_data <- barrks_data('stations')

head(station_data, 10)

```

To illustrate the beetle development at a specific station, `plot_development_diagram()`
is used. It is possible to add several phenology objects to the plot that will be
displayed as lines. The area between the lines of the particular generations
will be filled if the respective generation appears in all phenology objects.


```{r stations-diagram, message = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.dim=c(12,6), fig.cap = "Development diagram with different variants of PHENIPS-Clim"}

# calculate phenology with different parameters
pheno_sunny <- phenology('phenips-clim', station_data, exposure = 'sunny')
pheno_shaded <- phenology('phenips-clim', station_data, exposure = 'shaded')
pheno_last <- phenology('phenips-clim', station_data, exposure = 'shaded',
                        onset_mode = 0.9)

# plot development diagram
plot_development_diagram(list('sunny' = pheno_sunny,
                              'shaded' = pheno_shaded,
                              'shaded + late onset' = pheno_last),
                         xlim = as.Date(c('2011-03-15', '2011-12-31')),
                         .lty = 1:3)

```
